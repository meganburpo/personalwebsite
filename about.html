<h2> Born and Raised </h2>
<P> Hey everyone! My name is Megan Burpo and I am from West Springfield, Va. Growing up just 30 minutes away from Washington, DC meant that our nation's capital was my playground. There is nothing I love more than advantage of the rich history, art, and cusine the area has to offer. Hey everyone! My name is Megan Burpo and I am from West Springfield, Va. Growing up just 30 minutes away from Washington, DC meant that our nation's capital was my playground.

<p>My parents quickly spread their travel bug to my siblings and I. My dad was raised as a “Navy brat” and entered into a career in the Navy himself continuing the tradition of service. My mom was born and raised in Manchester, UK where I spent every summer visiting my grandparents. After seeing how important cultural immersion is, I took my passion for travel into my own hands and choose to study abroad in Dublin in 2014. It was an amazing time full of beautiful views, new friends, and a little bit of Guinness. This trip also inspired me to delve into the art of photography.

  <h2> Hokie Hokie Hokie Hi</h2>
  <p> As a proud Hokie I am exited to represent my school upon graduation day, but am not eager to leave the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains. In May 2016 I will be earning a major in Public Relations and a minor in Technical and Professional Writing. During my time at Virginia Tech I have been active in our campus life taking part in the SGA, Residential Leadership Community, and Alpha Phi Omega (APO) national co-ed service fraternity. I currently serve on the executive board for APO as the Vice President of Service and coordinate chapter projects and lead 28 sub-chairs. </p>

    <p>After graduation I am perusing a career in public relations. I have a passion for crisis communication, strategic thinking, and story telling. I have a background in both non-profit PR and agency work for commercial clients. My well-rounded experiences have taught me that no day in PR is the same, and adaptability is key. The fast-paced lifestyle that PR provides matches the energy I bring into my work. I hope to take my passion for Virignia Tech's motto, "Ut Prosim- That I May Serve", into my profesional life. My dream is use my PR skills to aid the development and sucess of a non-profit geared toward hunger relief and sustainable food.To learn more about my PR experiences visit my portfolio!  </p>

    <h2> Got Health? </h2>
  <p> When I am not in class you can find me outside being active. Whether hiking in the Blue Ridge Mountains or training for my second half marathon, I love spending time outside. Some of my favorite trails have been scaling the Cinque Terre in Italy, and climbing Old Rag in Harrsionburg, VA, and sitting on the edge of McAffe's Knob on the Appalachian trial. What's my favorite time to hike? You guessed it, sunrise! </p>
    <p> I believe that health is vital to a happy life. I am passionate about finding ways to make delicious foods that nourish our bodies and love when those reciepes contain chocolate. In my free-time I plant and tend the Blacksburg community garden. It is a great way to de-stress and provide equal opprotunity for every family to recieve proper nutrition.   </p>
